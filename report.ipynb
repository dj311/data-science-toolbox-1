    "# Data Science Toolbox: Literature Review\n",
    "By Shanglin Zou and Daniel Jones\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose to divide the work equally, resulting in a corresponding split of equity:\n",
    "  - Shanglin Zou: 50%\n",
    "  - Daniel Jones: 50%\n",

    "As part of a literature review, our key aim was to survey both the current and historical landscape of data science and it's relation to cyber-security. This covers a broad set of topics, which we broke down into the following three categories [1]:\n",
    "  1. Classical Statistics\n",
    "  2. Machine Learning\n",
    "  3. Neural Networks\n",
    "  \n",
    "We will aim to implement approaches from a couple of these fields in the practical part of this report.\n",
    " \n",
    "TODO: talk about literature\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are the broad types of data?\n",
    "### What are the main types of resource?\n",
    "We looked at:  books, papers, online tutorials, public code and data repositories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Books:\n",
    " - \"Introduction to Machine Learning\"\n",
    " \n",
    "Take-aways:\n",
    "  - There are lots of resources on statistics, machine learning and neural networks (within books, papers and online resources) but not many that apply this to cyber-security.\n",
    "  - secrepo.com proved a valuable resource for both data sets, and analysis of those data sources.\n",
    "  - academic papers provided a combination of the two (stats applied to cyber-security data) but code samples were hard to come by\n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "### What type of problems can the resources solve?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Are there any generic data science resources that might be applicable? In what sense are they applicable?\n",
    "Since there is little introductory material on data science applied to cyber-security, the generic data science resources proved useful to learn the theory behind it's application. Approach: read papers with direct application to cyber-security, and use generic data science resources to fill in knowledge gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Introduction to Machine learning\" proved to be a useful reference text to learn about k-Nearest-Neighbors classification, since the papers applying it to cyber-security assumed knowledge of the algorithm as a pre-requisite.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How might the approach be compared to other approaches, and/or applied across different datasets?"
